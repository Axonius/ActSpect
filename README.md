## 📦 Installation


### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- GitHub personal access token

### Install ActSpect
```bash
pip install actspect
```

### Install Optional Dependencies
For enhanced scanning capabilities:

#### OpenGrep/Semgrep Scanner
For static analysis scanning, install OpenGrep or Semgrep manually:

**Option 1: Install OpenGrep (recommended)**
```bash
# Download the latest release from GitHub
# Visit: https://github.com/opengrep/opengrep/releases
# Download the appropriate binary for your platform and add it to your PATH
```

**Option 2: Install Semgrep and create OpenGrep alias**
```bash
pip install semgrep
# Create an alias so ActSpect can find it as 'opengrep'
sudo ln -s $(which semgrep) /usr/local/bin/opengrep
```

#### Dependency Graph Generation
```bash
# For dependency graph visualization
sudo apt-get install graphviz  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install graphviz          # macOS
```

## 🔧 Quick Start

### 1. Set up your GitHub token
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token_here"
```

### 2. Basic workflow scan
```bash
actspect scan --repo owner/repository
```

### 3. Advanced scanning with custom options
```bash
actspect scan \
  --repo owner/repository \
  --scanner all \
  --min-severity medium \
  --max-depth 10 \
  --dependency-graph \
  --output-dir ./reports
```
